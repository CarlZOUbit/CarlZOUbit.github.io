The vehicle with an Arduino mega 2560 has the function of moving to all directions under the remote control, sensing obstacles, lifting its upper frame and sensing the moisture of the environment. The controller is built in Xcode with the function of connecting Bluetooth in vehicle, sending command towards vehicle and receiving data from Arduino. The whole system is carried out in reality. Functions of sensing obstacles, remote control, lifting frame and capturing moisture and temperature are validated in real environment. The result shows that the small vehicle can move, lift frame while sending moisture and temperature to controller.<br>Report: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_mechanics.pdf">https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_mechanics.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With surging applications of unmanned aircraft vehicle in fields of environmental protection, military and agriculture, the control of quadrotor unmanned aircraft vehicle is worth to be addressed. Aiming at finding a suitable control algorithm, two methods, proportion-feedback linearization (P- FD) and proportion-sliding mode (P-SM), are introduced into a micro-unmanned vehicle system. The control is divided into inner and outer loop. Velocity control is deployed on outer loop based on proportion control. Feedback linearization and sliding mode are applied in inner loop separately. The proposed two algorithms are tested and compared in aspect of attitude and velocity response characteristic by MATLAB/Simulink. The result shows that both methods can stabilize the attitude while P-FD performs better in tracking the required velocity.<br>Report:<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_nonlinear.pdf">https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_nonlinear.pdf</a></p>

In this project, a basketball is tracked in its falling way by method of machine vision. A stereo camera tracking system is designed and applied in tracking falling of the basketball. Stereo camera calibration, image recognition and 3D reconstruction are utilized in this project. With the establishment of a stereo camera system, the trajectory of ball-falling is detected. The information of the falling ball is derived in aspect of position, attitude, velocity and acceleration. Two experiment are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the system. Results show that the designed system can acquire a relatively high accuracy result. The obtained trajectory and attitude are consistent with observation. The velocity and acceleration of the ball is in accordance with the law of free fall.<br>Report:<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_3Dvision.pdf">https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_3Dvision.pdf</a></p>

Firstly, a simulation is carried out on the hypothesis that each part of the floating wind turbine is rigid. The analysis of the system is built based on Lagrange equation. Secondly, a Timoshenko beam model of the deformable tower is carried out based on Hamilton’s principle and Galerkin projection. After simulation in MATLAB/Simulink, the results are analyzed and discussed. The simulation results are verified to have a certain accuracy.<br>Report:<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_advanceddynamics.pdf">https://github.com/CarlZOUbit/CarlZOUbit.github.io/blob/master/attaches/Report_advanceddynamics.pdf</a></p>
